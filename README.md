# Data-Digitalization-with-Power-BI-on-BBPPTP-Surabaya

Developing an interactive dashboard that supports data management at the Balai Besar Perbenihan dan Proteksi Tanaman Perkebunan (BBPPTP) Surabaya. This project covers two main areas: protection and seed production. Previously, data related to pest infestations (Organisme Pengganggu Tumbuhan, or OPT) and seed production were often managed manually, leading to difficulties in accurate data monitoring and analysis.
